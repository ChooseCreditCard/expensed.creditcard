    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is an Expense-Focused Business Card?</h2>
      <p>
        An expense-focused business credit card is issued to a company or freelancer and used for work-related costs:
        travel, software, equipment, subscriptions and client expenses. Instead of everyone using personal cards,
        spending is centralized on accounts the business controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern providers often combine the card with software: expense apps, receipt capture, approval workflows and
        direct feeds into accounting systems. The goal is fewer manual reimbursements, less paperwork and clearer
        category-level insights.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Setup -->
    <section id="setup" class="section">
      <h2>How Business Card Setups Typically Work</h2>

      <h3>1. Main Account & Credit Line</h3>
      <p>
        The business is underwritten for a single credit line or charge-card limit. All employee cards draw against
        this shared capacity, with the company responsible for repayment.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Employee Cards & Virtual Cards</h3>
      <p>
        Individual plastic or virtual cards are issued to team members, sometimes per project or department. Virtual
        cards can be created for online tools, vendors or one-off campaigns, then frozen or deleted when no longer needed.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Policies & Spend Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Policies define where cards can be used: merchant categories, countries, spend caps, daily or monthly limits and
        whether ATM withdrawals are allowed. Good setups match rules to job roles, not just individuals.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Controls & Reporting -->
    <section id="controls" class="section">
      <h2>Controls, Approvals & Reporting</h2>

      <h3>Receipts & Categorisation</h3>
      <p>
        Modern expense platforms encourage (or require) employees to attach receipts in an app, tag projects or cost
        centers and add notes. This saves time at month-end and reduces disputes.
      </p>

      <h3>Real-Time Monitoring</h3>
      <p>
        Managers can often see spend in real time, freeze cards, adjust limits or decline specific transactions. This
        reduces the need for retroactive policing of expenses.
      </p>

      <h3>Accounting Integrations</h3>
      <p>
        Many business cards now integrate directly with accounting and ERP tools. Transaction data flows through with
        categories and tags, reducing manual entry and reconciliation work.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risks & Trade-offs -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risks and Trade-Offs</h2>
      <p>
        Centralising expenses on business cards can improve control — but it also concentrates risk. Poorly designed
        policies, weak oversight or overly high limits can turn into large unexpected balances.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also important to separate legitimate business use from mixed personal use, especially for tax and audit
        purposes. Clear internal policies and regular reviews help keep spend aligned with company goals.
