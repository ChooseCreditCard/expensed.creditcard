      <h2>What Does It Mean When Something Is “Expensed”?</h2>
      <p>When a purchase is “expensed”, it means the cost is recorded as a business expense rather than as personal spending. For card payments, this involves linking each transaction to a project, cost centre, department or policy category.</p>
      <p>In a card-based setup, the employee uses a company card and the organization pays the statement. The goal is to capture enough information around each transaction to satisfy accounting, tax and internal policy requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>The Flow From Card Swipe to Approved Expense</h2>
      <p>Most business expense processes follow the same basic pattern, regardless of which card issuer or software provider is involved.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>1. Transaction</strong> – the employee pays with a business or B2B card.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Import</strong> – transactions flow into an expense tool or banking portal.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Coding</strong> – the transaction is assigned to a category, project or cost centre.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Documentation</strong> – receipts are attached, notes are added where necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Approval</strong> – a manager or finance role reviews and approves or rejects.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Posting</strong> – the approved expense is exported or synced to the accounting system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some steps can be automated, but they still rely on clear rules: which expenses are allowed, what documentation is required and who signs off for which amounts.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Receipts, Documentation and Audit Trails</h2>
      <p>Regulators and auditors expect companies to be able to show what was purchased, when, for which business purpose and under which policy. Card statements alone rarely provide enough detail.</p>
      <p>Modern expense tools encourage employees to capture receipts via mobile apps, email forwarding or direct upload. Many systems extract merchant, amount, date and tax details automatically, but the employee or approver still needs to confirm that the purchase is legitimate and properly categorized.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Policies, Limits and Exceptions</h2>
      <p>Even with detailed data, card-based expense management depends on clear policies. These define which expenses are allowed, what daily or trip-based limits apply and how exceptions should be handled.</p>
      <p>Some organizations rely heavily on card controls (for example blocking certain merchant categories). Others allow wider card usage but apply stricter review at the expense-approval stage. The right balance depends on size, risk tolerance and regulatory environment.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Reimbursements vs. Company Card Spend</h2>
      <p>Not all expenses are paid directly with a company card. In some cases, employees pay out of pocket and request reimbursement later, while in others the card handles almost all eligible spend.</p>
      <p>From an expense-management perspective, the same questions arise: is the expense allowed under policy, is documentation complete, and has the right approver signed off? The main difference is whether the company is paying a card statement or reimbursing an individual.</p>
